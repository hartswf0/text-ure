# **The Medium as Operator: From Ritual Belonging to Technical Systems**

The evolution of modern media theory represents a movement from the analysis of message content to an investigation of the medium as a generative operator that scripts the parameters of social, cognitive, and technical existence. This shift necessitates a rigorous comparison between the ritualistic, world-building view of communication championed by James Carey and the materialist, deterministic inscription systems theorized by Friedrich Kittler. By examining the bridge provided by Guillaume Apollinaire’s calligrammatic experiments and the contemporary computational framework of Hannes Bajohr’s operative ekphrasis, a new paradigm emerges: the spatial-semantic grid. This report explores how these disparate theories synthesize into a protocol for AI-driven text-image generation, where the medium does not merely transmit information but serves as an ontological substrate for reality itself.

## **The Ritual View of Communication and the Construction of Worldhood**

The foundational dichotomy in communication studies is defined by the tension between the transmission model and the ritual model. James Carey posits that the transmission view is the commonest conception of communication in industrial cultures, rooted in the nineteenth-century metaphor of transportation.1 Under this view, communication is defined by the "extension of messages across geography for the purpose of control".1 It is a model of influence and reach, where the primary objective is to move information faster and farther across space to overcome distance and establish power.1 This vision, Carey argues, is divinely inspired by the desire to spread messages "farther and faster, eclipsing time and transcending space".1

In contrast, the ritual view of communication is the oldest of all visions, yet it has remained a lesser narrative in Western academia due to an intellectual preoccupation with technical control.2 For Carey, the ritual view is not directed toward the "extension of messages in space, but the maintenance of society in time".2 It is not the act of imparting information but the "creation, representation, and celebration of shared beliefs".2 Communication in this sense is akin to a sacred ceremony that draws persons together in fellowship and commonality.1

### **The Miracle of Social Life and the Deweyan Legacy**

Carey’s ritual model is deeply indebted to the pragmatism of John Dewey, who emphasized the inherent link between the words "common," "community," and "communication".1 Dewey argued that society exists not only by communication but *in* communication, asserting that "men live in a community in virtue of the things which they have in common; and communication is the way in which they come to possess things in common".1 Carey interprets this as the "miracle of social life"—the capacity for human beings to pull off social order through the participatory ritual of symbolic exchange.2

The "miracle" refers to the human ability to create a culture comprising a "common stock of symbols" that contains the meanings of action and the practices that embody them.4 In Carey’s framework, reality is not a given entity that exists independent of language; rather, it is "brought into existence, is produced, by communication—by, in short, the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms".4 This leads to the central axiom of Carey's cultural approach: "We first produce the world by symbolic work and then take up residence in the world we have produced".4

### **Communication as World-Production and Repair**

Under the ritual view, the primary function of communication is the construction and maintenance of an ordered, meaningful cultural world that can serve as a container for human action.1 Carey defines communication as a "symbolic process whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired, and transformed".2 This definition suggests that communication is an active, ongoing gesture of world-building that requires constant participation to prevent the collapse into chaos.

Carey illustrates this through the example of newspaper reading. While a transmission view sees news as the acquisition of information, a ritual view sees it as attending a mass.1 Reading the paper is a dramatic act in which "nothing new is learned but in which a particular view of the world is portrayed and confirmed".1 The news does not describe the world so much as it "portrays an arena of dramatic forces and action," inviting the reader to assume social roles within it.1

| Feature | Transmission Model | Ritual Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Goal** | Influence across space / Control | Maintenance through time / Continuity |
| **Metaphor** | Transportation / Signal Flow | Ceremony / Mass / Dance |
| **Role of Message** | Signal to be decoded | Script to be enacted |
| **Outcome** | Extension and reach | Participation and repair |
| **Definition of Success** | Speed and accuracy of transfer | Coherence and shared faith |

## **Materialist Inscription Systems and the Technical Determinism of the Media**

While Carey focuses on the symbolic maintenance of the social world, Friedrich Kittler approaches media as technical conditions that "determine our situation".9 Kittler rejects the humanistic focus on meaning, arguing that media are technical apparatuses that govern what can be stored, processed, and retrieved.10 For Kittler, "media define what constitutes reality," and they are always already ahead of aesthetics and human understanding.10

### **The Monopoly of Writing and the Bottleneck of the Signifier**

Kittler argues that prior to the technological differentiation of the late nineteenth century, writing held an absolute monopoly over time and history.10 Everything that took place had to pass through the "defile of the signifier"—the twenty-six letters of the alphabet—which functioned as a general filter for all data flows.10 This "alphabetic monopoly" reduced the world to what could be written, excluding noise sequences and raw sensory data.10

Literature, in this era, had to arrest the "real streams of data" in the system of letters, meaning that history was a homogeneous field that only included cultures with written language.10 Reading in the discourse network of the 1800s functioned as "hallucinating a meaning between letters and lines".11 Kittler posits that this monopoly began to end with the emergence of technical media like the gramophone and film, which could store the "Real" of physical noise and time without passing through the symbolic bottleneck.10

### **The Technical Differentiation of the Discourse Network 1900**

The emergence of the gramophone, film, and typewriter around 1880 fundamentally altered human perception and the fabrication of "man".10 Kittler analyzes these as distinct inscription systems that reorganized the human sensorium:

1. **The Gramophone**: It revolutionized sound by recording physical traces on wax or tinfoil rather than symbolic notations on paper.9 The phonograph records "all the noise produced by the larynx prior to any semiotic order," thereby capturing the acoustic "Real".13  
2. **The Film**: Moving pictures reorganized vision into a series of still images that create the illusion of motion.9 Film captures the "Imaginary," the mirror image of a body that appears more perfect than the motor control of the actual subject.10  
3. **The Typewriter**: Writing was standardized and mechanized, detaching the script from the "handwriting of the soul".14 Typing turned the soul into "Gutenbergiana," where black letters on white paper no longer stored an individual individual’s "spiritual nakedness" but represented discrete elements of a technical system.10

Kittler’s theory suggests that "so-called man becomes physiology on the one hand and information technology on the other".10 The essence of humanity is seen as running through apparatuses, where machines conquer the functions of the central nervous system.10

### **General Digitalization and the Erasure of the Medium**

The trajectory of Kittler’s thought culminates in the "general digitalization of information," where the difference between individual media vanishes.10 Sound and image, voice and text become mere "effects on the surface" or "interfaces for the consumer".10 In this state, the "monopoly of bits and fiber optics" replaces the monopoly of writing.10 Absolute knowledge runs as an endless loop, and the senses become "mere glitter" or "eyewash".10

| Technology | Lacanian Registry | Function | Status of Human |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Writing** | Symbolic | Encoding / Filtering | Hallucinating Subject |
| **Gramophone** | Real | Acoustic Storage | Physiological Trace |
| **Film** | Imaginary | Visual Reorganization | Mirror Image |
| **Computer** | Universal Sign | Processing / Retrieval | Information Effect |

## **The Topological Bridge: Guillaume Apollinaire’s Calligram as Operational Signal**

Guillaume Apollinaire acts as a crucial historical bridge between Carey’s ritual world and Kittler’s technical apparatus. Through his invention of the "calligram," Apollinaire sought to transform linear text into spatial geometry, creating a "typographical record" that integrated the impact of modern technology on lyric poetry.19

### **Lettre-Océan and the TSF Metaphor**

Published in June 1914, *Lettre-Océan* (Ship-to-Ship Letter) represents Apollinaire’s most radical experiment in "typographical simultaneity".22 The title refers to messages transmitted via wireless telegraphy (TSF: *télégraphie sans fil*), and the poem’s visual-verbal fabric is designed to enact the functioning of language under these conditions.20

The spatial layout of *Lettre-Océan* is organized around two large wheel-and-spoke patterns radiating from a circular center.25 These shapes evoke the Eiffel Tower, which served as a radio tower for radiographic messages at the time.20 The poem uses mathematical signs and Arabic numerals, such as "Pendeco c'est \+ qu'un imbécile" and "Haute de 300 mètres," to integrate technical precision into the lyric voice.20

#### **Spatial Meaning and Word-Bridges**

The spatial organization of *Lettre-Océan* functions as a psychovisual collage:

* **Shorelines and Postcards**: The poem begins with typographical shorelines representing the Rhine (France) and the Gulf of Mexico, with a central area organized around the words "TARJETA POSTAL".20  
* **The Voice across Distance**: The line "Ta voix me parvient malgré l’énorme distance" (Your voice reaches me despite the enormous distance) acts as a spatial "word-bridge" between continents, enacting the voice crossing the expanse of the ocean.20  
* **The Recorded Cacophony**: On the second page, concentric lines with the bolded word "gramophones" mimic the grooves of a record, recasting the poem as a playback of urban *rumeurs*.20

### **L’Esprit Nouveau and the Poetics of Surprise**

In his 1917 lecture "L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes," Apollinaire articulated a modernist manifesto calling for "pure invention" and a rejection of traditional conventions.26 He argued that "modern poets are above all singers of a constantly new truth" and that the central principle of avant-garde art is the "total freedom of the artist".27

Apollinaire emphasized the role of "surprise," which he considered the most modern of principles, as a means to escape reason and generate "new and uncontrollable values".27 The poet acts as a "kind of god," using "alchemical magic" to translate the turbulent atmosphere of the new material landscape into a "mosaic of images and ideas".27 This poetics of surprise is the mechanism through which the "New Spirit" distinguishes itself, choosing adventure over the complacency of the quotidian.27

| Apollinaire Principle | Functional Equivalent | Ritual / Technical Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ideogram** | Spatial Still Life | Mimesis of technical objects |
| **TSF** | Radiographic transmission | Eiffel Tower as signal node |
| **Surprise** | Epistemic break | Rejection of clichéd forms |
| **Simultaneity** | Non-linear traversal | Perception at a single glance |
| **4th Dimension** | Immensity of space | Extending in all directions |

## **Operative Ekphrasis and the Connectionist Turn in Multimodal AI**

The intersection of media theory and artificial intelligence is best understood through Hannes Bajohr’s concept of "operative ekphrasis." Building on the rhetorical tradition of ekphrasis—the verbal representation of visual art—Bajohr introduces a digital paradigm where text does not describe an image but "computationally brings about an image".29

### **Two-Text Duality and the Causal Relationship**

Bajohr distinguishes digital works from analog ones through a "two-text duality." In analog works, such as a typewriter poem, there is only the text on the page, which does not "perform" anything.29 In digital works, there is a "duality of text" where the first text (the code) carries out an operation to effectively produce the second text (the visible constellation-image).29

This creates a "causal relationship" rather than a mimetic one. The image is the result of the "manipulation of information," which is itself textual in nature.29 In this context, the prompt is the medium, and the generation is the reading—a performance where "words painting a picture" is an operation of manipulating symbolic information.29

### **Sequential vs. Connectionist Paradigms**

Bajohr identifies a critical distinction between two digital models:

1. **Sequential Paradigm**: Based on classic algorithms and code, this model follows linear instructions to process data. It possesses syntax but lacks semantics; the code "acts" without carrying inherent meaning.30  
2. **Connectionist Paradigm**: Realized in multimodal AI like DALL·E, this paradigm uses artificial neural networks to integrate multiple data types.29 Here, text and image are not merely correlated; they are collapsed into a "shared third" or "multimodal pictorial third" within the artificial neuron.31

In the connectionist model, ekphrasis "transcends the difference" between mediums entirely.30 Both text and image are encoded as the same type of information within the technical system, allowing the weights of the neural network to "mean" without traditional speech acts.32

### **Artificial Semantics: The Return of Meaning**

A major conclusion of Bajohr’s argument is that "semantics nevertheless returns to the digital," which was previously seen only as a matter of syntax.30 He introduces the concept of "artificial semantics" (or "dumb meaning") to describe the inherent meaning generated through the correlation of text and image within the system.32

This artificial semantics is what makes AI models interesting artifacts; they generate connotations based on statistical correlation rather than human intentionality.32 In the age of machine learning, the "author function" is distributed across a network of actors and technical systems, leading to a future theory of "causal authorship".34

| Concept | Sequential (Old Digital) | Connectionist (Modern AI) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Logic** | Syntactic / Algorithmic | Semantic / Statistical |
| **Media Relation** | Separation / Transformation | Fusion / Shared Third |
| **Operation** | Code "Acts" | Weights "Mean" |
| **Ekphrasis** | Transition | Transcendence |
| **Information** | Discrete signals | Enriched information types |

## **Synthesis: The 24x24 Spatial Semantic Grid as Operational Ritual**

The convergence of the theories discussed leads to the "spatial-semantic grid"—a 24x24 protocol that synthesizes Carey’s ritual world, Kittler’s address space, Apollinaire’s calligram, and Bajohr’s operative ekphrasis. In this grid, the medium is not a stage for content but an operator that scripts reality through spatial and technical logic.

### **The Grid as Ritual Engine (Carey Mode)**

From the ritual perspective, the grid is a world, not a page \[Prompt\]. It is a "public model of reality" that users enter, traverse, and rehearse.1 The grid acts as a container for human action where society managing to "produce and reproduce itself" is enacted through traversal.4

The grid is divided into topological zones that fulfill the Careyian ritual functions:

* **Center Core (10-13, 10-13)**: Function \= **PRODUCE**. The sacred center where the primary world-model is generated.  
* **Inner Ring (7-16, 7-16)**: Function \= **MAINTAIN**. The area dedicated to the continuity and representation of shared beliefs.  
* **Middle Ring (4-19, 4-19)**: Function \= **REPAIR**. The zone where symbolic breaks are mended and social bonds are reinforced.  
* **Outer Ring (1-24, 1-24)**: Function \= **TRANSFORM**. The boundary where the world-model encounters the unknown and undergoes structural change.

### **The Grid as Addressable Inscription (Kittler Mode)**

From the Kittlerian perspective, the grid is address space where movement is a scan-head and the beam is a read operation \[Prompt\]. Semantics are not primitives; only the "address," "payload," and "retrieval metadata" are primitives.10 The grid reorganizes literature into "addressable memory space," fulfilling the Kittlerian trajectory of media determining our situation.10

The Inscription System Protocol forbids purely decorative geometry or "importance-based" placement \[Prompt\]. Instead, it requires:

* A 24x24 grid manifest with payload and metadata for each cell.  
* A segmentation pipeline that converts poetry into blocks suitable for addressing.  
* Allocation regimes (redundancy-spread, density-stack) that determine how data is stored \[Prompt\].

### **The Grid as Operative Calligram (Apollinaire/Bajohr Mode)**

The grid functions as a "machine-calligram," where geometry precedes reading and topology encodes meaning.25 It is a system of "operative ekphrasis" where the operative text (the manifest/code) causally produces the surface text (the rendered constellations).30

The "Calligram Layer" is governed by a schema that includes:

* **GlyphFlow**: SPIRAL | COLUMN | RADIATE | WAVE. These represent the "metaphysical movement of the poet's thought".27  
* **StrokeWeight and Material**: HAIRLINE to BLACK; INK to ASH or NEON. These define the "materiality of the trace" that Kittler identifies in handwriting.17  
* **Density**: A scale (1-10) determining how much spatial territory a chunk occupies \[Prompt\].

### **Spatial Mapping First Principles**

The operation of this synthesis is guided by the following axioms derived from the combined media theories:

1. **Space as Addressing System**: The grid is not a stage for representation but a register for operations \[Prompt\].  
2. **Two-Text Performance**: Meaning resides in the "mapping operation"—how the operative text transforms into the surface constellation.30  
3. **Geometry as Grammar**: Shapes like rings (recursion) and spirals (descent) act as constraint grammars for reading \[Prompt\].  
4. **Semantic Functions**: Elements like INVOCATION, CHANT, and WITNESS are functions that the grid cells stage as acts.2  
5. **Positive Silence**: Voids are not empty spaces but "positive semantic regions" where silence has shape \[Prompt\].

#### **The Calculus of the Operative Grid**

The transition of a textual element ![][image1] into a cell ![][image2] at address ![][image3] can be modeled as an operation of the medium-operator ![][image4]:

![][image5]  
where ![][image6] is the zone function (Produce, Maintain, Repair, Transform) and ![][image7] is the calligrammatic constraint (GlyphFlow, Density). The total reality produced by the grid ![][image8] is the sum of all cell operations over the traversal path ![][image9]:

![][image10]  
This model ensures that the generation is the reading, and the traversal is the act of world-production.

## **Final Synthesis: The Medium as Ontological Operator**

The comparison of James Carey’s ritualism and Friedrich Kittler’s materialism reveals a profound tension in the heart of media theory: media as a shared faith versus media as a technical prison. However, the bridge provided by Guillaume Apollinaire and the digital expansion of Hannes Bajohr suggest that these two views are not mutually exclusive but represent the dual nature of the modern medium.

In the age of AI text-image generation, the prompt acts as a ritual script (Carey) that scripts social-technical relations, while the model functions as an inscription apparatus (Kittler) that determines what can be stored and retrieved \[Prompt\]. The resulting output is a calligram—a text-as-image-as-world where geometry and meaning are collapsed into a shared "pictorial third".32

The "Medium as Operator" is the realization of Apollinaire’s "New Spirit," where poetry and creation are the same thing.20 It is a system of "artificial semantics" that bypasses the bottleneck of the signifier to produce reality directly from symbolic manipulation.30 Ultimately, the 24x24 spatial-semantic grid serves as the protocol for this new era—a world where communication does not just describe reality but effectively brings it about through the operational performance of the grid. Truth, as Apollinaire suggested, is "always new," and in the operational medium, truth is a product of the mapping itself.27
