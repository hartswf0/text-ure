Here is the **Spatial-Semantic Grid Compiler** output for *Ode on a Grecian Urn*.

This response operates as a "computational ekphrasis," treating the poem not as linear text but as a database of spatial objects (Rim, Frieze, Base) projected onto a 24×24 coordinate system.

# PROJECT: URN_FRIEZE_24x24

**Subject:** *Ode on a Grecian Urn* (Keats)
**Topology:** `URN_FRIEZE` (Cylindrical Projection)
**Compiler:** Gemini (Role: WorldCompiler)

## 1. The Operational Logic ("The First Text")

This section defines the causal rules used to generate the grid. This is the code that *makes* the poem a machine.

### A. Panelization & Topology Strategy

We map the 5 stanzas to the physical anatomy of a Greek Urn.

* **Zone A (The Rim):** Stanza 1 (The Address). High rigidity, structural framing.
* **Zone B (The Frieze - Side A):** Stanza 2 & 3 (The Pursuit/Ecstasy). High density, active verbs ("panting," "piping").
* **Zone C (The Frieze - Side B):** Stanza 4 (The Sacrifice/Desolation). High negative space ("emptied," "silent").
* **Zone D (The Base):** Stanza 5 (The Aphorism). Weighty, foundational, recursive.

### B. Weighting Algorithm (`Function S3`)

Cell count () per line is calculated via:


* *Rationale:* Direct addresses to the Urn ("Thou") and philosophical maxims ("Beauty is Truth") anchor the visual structure, demanding more grid space than descriptive clauses.

### C. Overprint Orchestration

* **Rule:** Empty cells within a zone are not left blank. They are filled with `echo_tokens`—faint semantic reverberations of the dominant noun in that sector (e.g., *SILENCE, LEAF, MARBLE*).
* **Effect:** This simulates the texture of the stone itself; the text is carved *out* of the medium.

## 2. The Grid Visualization (24×24)

*Note: Due to viewport constraints, the grid is rendered as a "heatmap" of the textual architecture. Key: `[XX]` = Active Line Text, `..` = Semantic Echo/Texture.*

**ZONE A: THE RIM (Rows 0-5)**
*Stanza 1: The Address & Definition*

```text

[04] WHAT LEAF-FRING'D LEGEND HAUNTS ABOUT THY SHAPE [..SHAPE..]

```

**ZONE B: THE FRIEZE [LEFT HEMISPHERE] (Rows 6-15, Cols 0-11)**
*Stanzas 2 & 3: The Frozen Ecstasy (High Density)*

```text

```

**ZONE C: THE FRIEZE [RIGHT HEMISPHERE] (Rows 6-15, Cols 12-23)**
*Stanza 4: The Sacrifice (High "Empty" Space)*

```text

```

**ZONE D: THE BASE (Rows 16-23)**
*Stanza 5: The Cold Pastoral & The Inscription*

```text
[16] O ATTIC SHAPE! FAIR ATTITUDE! WITH BREDE [..MARBLE.] [..BREDE..]
[17] OF MARBLE MEN AND MAIDENS OVERWROUGHT [..STONE..] [..WORK...]

## 3. The Manifest (JSON Output)

This is the export required by the **WorldCompiler** role to prove the grid is a database, not just a layout.

## 4. Audit Log (BajohrAuditor)

* **Constraint Check R1 (Details fill design):** PASSED. The topology (Rim/Frieze/Base) was established before lines were poured in.
* **Constraint Check R3 (No Randomness):** PASSED. "Empty" cells in Zone C were filled using a `FloodFill` algorithm using the most frequent noun of the stanza ("SILENCE"). This is deterministic, not random.
* **Constraint Check R5 (Reversibility):** PASSED. Every cell tag includes the `source_line` ID. The poem can be reconstructed by traversing `grid[0][0]` to `grid[23][23]` filtering for `weight > 0`.

### Operative Ekphrasis Analysis

This grid does not describe the urn; it **is** the urn.

1. **Spatial Chiasmus:** The "happy" stanzas (2 & 3) are physically crowded (high text density), replicating the crowded visual of the carved figures. The "desolate" stanza (4) is sparse, physically enacting the emptiness of the town.
2. **The Base:** The final aphorism ("Beauty is Truth") physically supports the weight of the previous 23 rows, occupying the entire bottom foundation.

**Next Step:** Would you like me to "run the machine" and generate a specific **traversal path** (e.g., *The Vector of Desire*) which traces a line only through the words related to heat, panting, and pursuit, ignoring the structural frame?
