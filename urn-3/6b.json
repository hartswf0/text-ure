Here is the specification for the **Keats Inscription System (KIS-01)**. This design treats the poem not as literature, but as a dataset requiring specific topological preservation within a 576-cell () memory architecture.

### O1. The Line Index

*A normalized database of atomic units. This strips the poem of formatting to prepare for spatial injection.*

**Data Structure Definition:**
`LineObject = { id: string, stanza: int, seq: int, text: string, type: enum, weight: float }`

**Sample Index (Truncated for brevity, full 50 lines processed):**

| Line ID | Stanza | Seq | Type | Text Segment | Weight (Semantic Load) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **S1.L01** | 1 | 01 | `ADDR` | Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, | 1.0 |
| **S1.L02** | 1 | 02 | `ADDR` | Thou foster-child of silence and slow time, | 1.0 |
| **S2.L01** | 2 | 11 | `PARA` | Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard | 1.2 |
| **S2.L02** | 2 | 12 | `INST` | Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; | 1.1 |
| **S3.L01** | 3 | 21 | `LOOP` | Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed | 0.8 |
| **S4.L01** | 4 | 31 | `VOID` | Who are these coming to the sacrifice? | 1.0 |
| **S5.L09** | 5 | 49 | `CORE` | "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all | **2.0** |
| **S5.L10** | 5 | 50 | `CORE` | Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." | **2.0** |

### O2. The Panel Model (Assemblage Layer)

*Logical groupings based on Ekphrasis Mechanisms. These determine storage topology.*

**Panel A: The Interface Shell (Address)**

* **Rationale:** The outer layer of the urn. The user's entry point.
* **Mechanisms:** Address (invocation), Object-Definition.
* **Members:** Stanza 1 (L1-4), Stanza 5 (L1-8).
* **Tagset:** `[surface]`, `[silence]`, `[historian]`.

**Panel B: The Kinetic Frieze (The Pursuit)**

* **Rationale:** High-frequency movement. Needs rapid retrieval to simulate "mad pursuit."
* **Mechanisms:** Frozen Action, Unheard Audio.
* **Members:** Stanza 1 (L5-10), Stanza 2 (L1-4).
* **Tagset:** `[chase]`, `[pipes]`, `[ecstasy]`.

**Panel C: The Static Loop (The Youth)**

* **Rationale:** Infinite recursion. The system creates a lock where the pointer never advances.
* **Mechanisms:** Ritual Loop.
* **Members:** Stanza 2 (L5-10), Stanza 3 (Full).
* **Tagset:** `[never_fade]`, `[forever_warm]`.

**Panel D: The Desolation Buffer (The Empty Town)**

* **Rationale:** A pointer to off-site memory. The town is not on the urn; it is an inferred void.
* **Mechanisms:** Address (Interrogation), Null Reference.
* **Members:** Stanza 4 (Full).
* **Tagset:** `[sacrifice]`, `[desolate]`, `[silent]`.

**Panel E: The Kernel (The Dictum)**

* **Rationale:** The immutable output. The system's axiom. High redundancy required.
* **Mechanisms:** Epigram Output.
* **Members:** Stanza 5 (L9-10).
* **Tagset:** `[truth]`, `[beauty]`.

### O3. Grid Allocation ()

*Mapping the Urn's geometry to address space. We utilize a Polar-to-Cartesian projection where the center of the grid represents the interior of the urn (The Kernel) and the perimeter represents the surface (The Interface).*

**Coordinate System:**
Center .
Radius .

**Zoning Strategy (Concentric Storage Bands):**

1. **Zone E (The Kernel) | **
* **Cells:** ~48 central cells.
* **Content:** S5.L09-10 repeating.
* **Redundancy:** `CORE`. Every cell contains the full dictum. High error tolerance.
* **Beacon:** TRUE (High intensity).


2. **Zone C (The Static Loop) | **
* **Cells:** ~150 cells surrounding the core.
* **Content:** Panel C (The Youth/Trees).
* **Redundancy:** `ECHO`. Interleaved repetition. "Forever piping" requires the data to physically loop around the core.


3. **Zone B (The Kinetic Frieze) | **
* **Cells:** ~110 cells.
* **Content:** Panel B (The Pursuit).
* **Redundancy:** `GLUE`. High density. Short fragments packed tight to simulate "wild ecstasy" and clutter.


4. **Zone D (The Desolation Buffer) | **
* **Cells:** ~100 cells.
* **Content:** Panel D (The Empty Town).
* **Redundancy:** `LOW`. Sparse allocation. Many empty cells or "silence" characters to simulate spatial emptiness.


5. **Zone A (The Interface Shell) | **
* **Cells:** The perimeter ring (approx 160 cells).
* **Content:** Panel A (The Address).
* **Redundancy:** `CORE`. This shields the inner data.
* **Beacon:** TRUE (Entry headers).



**Visualization of Grid :**

```text
[A][A][A][A][A][A][A]...
[A] [D] [D] [D] [D] [A]...
[A] [D] [B] [B] [D] [A]...
[A] [D] [B] [C] [B] [D] [A]...
[A] [D] [B] [C] [E] [C] [B] [D] [A]...
... [Center E] ...

```

### O4. Retrieval Ruleset (The Raycaster)

*How the reading head traverses the memory grid.*

**1. Beacon Detection Grammar:**
The reader scans the perimeter (Zone A).


* **Rule:** If a cell contains "Thou" or "Shape", initiate `READ_PROTOCOL`.
* **Constraint:** The reader cannot access Zone E (Truth) without traversing Zones A  B/C  E.

**2. Panel Lock Behavior (Sampling Bias):**
When the raycaster enters a Zone (e.g., Zone C - The Loop):

* **Lock:** Movement vector is constrained to the tangent of the ring.
* **Effect:** The reader is forced to "rotate" around the urn (read the frieze laterally) rather than piercing straight to the center.
* **Release:** Only a specific "Break" token (e.g., "Tease us out of thought") allows radial movement inward.

**3. Seek Cost Metric:**
Movement cost  is defined by radial shift:



Where  is the resistance of the medium.

* **Result:** It is cheap to read *about* the urn (circumference), but expensive to reach the *meaning* (center).
* **Exception:** Zone D (Empty Town) has 0 friction, representing the absence of life/data.

### O5. Compiler Plan

*Serialization Protocol: Flattening the 2D Urn back into a 1D Stream.*

To preserve the topological relations in a linear stream, we do not use standard raster scanning. We use a **Spiral Injection Path**.

**Protocol:**

1. **Start:** Coordinate .
2. **Algorithm:** Traverse the grid in a square spiral (outward to inward, or perimeter-in).
* *Note:* For this archive, we use **Perimeter-In** to match the reading experience (Surface  Core).


3. **Delimiters:**
* `||` = Cell Boundary.
* `>>` = Zone Transition (Radial Shift).
* `{{` / `}}` = Redundancy Block (Compressed repetitions).



**Output Stream Logic:**

```text
[HEADER_META]
>> ZONE_A_START
|| S1.L1 || S1.L2 || ... (Perimeter data)
>> ZONE_D_START
|| S4.L1 || [NULL] || [NULL] || S4.L2 ... (Sparse data)
>> ZONE_B_START
|| S1.L5 || S1.L6 ... (Dense data)
>> ZONE_E_START
{{ S5.L9-10 (x48 Replicas) }}
[EOF]

```

**Seam Markers:**
To ensure the "Cold Pastoral" effect, line breaks are not stored as `\n` but as distinct glyphs `¶` within the cell payload. This forces the renderer to acknowledge the artificiality of the break.

### Next Step

Would you like me to generate a **JSON map** of this grid, or write a Python script that instantiates this  array and "pours" the text into the spiral zones?
