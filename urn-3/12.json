This response provides the requested operational schemas. These define the **Ritual Grid (24x24)** as a machine-enforceable environment where the text of Keats' *Ode on a Grecian Urn* performs the function of a "Ritual World" (Carey) rather than a static document.

The following schemas are formatted as strict JSON definitions, utilizing the Type System provided in the prompt.

---

### 1. Grid Definition (The World Container)

This schema establishes the 24x24 coordinate system. It rejects the "transmission view" of communication (sending information) in favor of the "ritual view" (representing shared beliefs).

*Figure 1: Conceptual visualization of the grid's "Zonal" layout, where the linear text wraps the grid like a frieze on an Urn.*

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ops-schemas.org/v1/grid",
  "id": "GRID_URN_24x24",
  "context": "Carey_Ritual_Model",
  "dimensions": {
    "rows": 24,
    "columns": 24,
    "total_cells": 576
  },
  "axioms": {
    "G1_WORLD_NOT_PAGE": "The grid is a habitable environment, not a storage medium.",
    "G2_SILENCE_IS_STRUCTURAL": "Empty cells are not null; they are 'SilenceKind' operators.",
    "G3_TIME_IS_SPATIAL": "Narrative time converts to grid coordinates (x,y)."
  },
  "global_constraints": {
    "entropy_limit": "Prohibits random distribution; cells must cluster by 'RitualAct'.",
    "silence_threshold": 0.15, 
    "required_motifs": ["ETERNITY", "MUSIC", "SILENCE", "SACRIFICE"]
  },
  "layer_definitions": {
    "0": "COORDINATE (Physical address)",
    "1": "TEXTUAL (Keats fragment)",
    "2": "OPERATIONAL (WorldOp state)",
    "3": "RITUAL (Act and Role bindings)"
  }
}

```

---

### 2. Zone Schema (The Territories)

The Grid is divided into concentric rings (Carey’s model) or distinct topographic regions (The Urn’s surface). Zones define the *physics* of that specific area.

#### Zone Definition: `ZONE_01_THE_FRIEZE` (Inner Ring)

*The area of "mad pursuit" and "wild ecstasy."*

```json
{
  "zone_id": "ZONE_01_THE_FRIEZE",
  "topology": "RING",
  "bounds": {
    "type": "radial_range",
    "r_min": 5,
    "r_max": 15
  },
  "operational_profile": {
    "world_operation": "MAINTAIN",
    "dominant_roles": ["WITNESS", "CONGREGANT"],
    "allowed_acts": ["CHANT", "INVOCATION"]
  },
  "physics": {
    "time_flow": "LOOP", 
    "decay_rate": 0.0, 
    "note": "Keats' 'For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd'. State cannot transition to BROKEN."
  },
  "gates": {
    "entry": {
      "coords": ["(6,12)"],
      "requirement": "MUST_HOLD_TOKEN: 'Sylvan Historian'"
    },
    "exit": {
      "coords": ["(14,12)"],
      "leads_to": "ZONE_02_THE_VOID",
      "handoff_op": "OPEN_GAP"
    }
  },
  "motif_enforcement": {
    "required": ["PIPES", "TIMBRELS"],
    "forbidden": ["OLD_AGE", "WOE"]
  }
}

```

#### Zone Definition: `ZONE_02_THE_VOID` (Outer Ring)

*The "little town" that is emptied; the silence.*

```json
{
  "zone_id": "ZONE_02_THE_VOID",
  "topology": "PERIMETER",
  "bounds": {
    "type": "cartesian_box",
    "x_range": [18, 24],
    "y_range": [18, 24]
  },
  "operational_profile": {
    "world_operation": "TRANSFORM",
    "dominant_roles": ["PILGRIM", "ARCHIVIST"],
    "allowed_acts": ["QUESTION", "WITNESS"]
  },
  "physics": {
    "silence_density": "HIGH",
    "silence_kind": "REDACTION"
  },
  "payload_constraint": {
    "max_word_count": 0,
    "allowed_symbolism": "GEOMETRY_ONLY"
  }
}

```

### 3. Cell Schema (The Atomic Unit)

This schema governs the individual ritual unit. A cell does not just "contain" text; it performs an operation on the reader (Pilgrim).

#### Instance: Cell (23, 23) - The Truth/Beauty Seal

```json
{
  "coord": "(23,23)",
  "zone_id": "ZONE_CORE_AXIOM",
  "state_vector": {
    "cell_state": "SEALED",
    "world_operation": "PRODUCE",
    "ritual_act": "SEAL",
    "evidence_level": "SOURCELOCK"
  },
  "payload": {
    "text_fragment": "Beauty is truth, truth beauty",
    "symbolic_form": "CHIASMUS",
    "time_signature": "EPOCHAL"
  },
  "operators": {
    "on_enter": ["DECLARE_WORLD", "SEAL_PREMISE"],
    "on_perform": ["TRANSPOSE_MODEL_OF_FOR"],
    "on_exit": ["HALT_TRAVERSAL"]
  },
  "adjacency_logic": {
    "north_neighbor": {
      "meaning": "DEVELOPMENT",
      "rule": "Must provide 'That is all ye know'"
    },
    "diagonal_neighbor": {
      "meaning": "TENSION",
      "rule": "Must contrast with 'Woe'"
    }
  },
  "silence_mechanics": {
    "is_silence_cell": false,
    "gap_generation": "None. This cell is absolute density."
  }
}

```

---

### 4. Traversal Schema (The Ritual Path)

Movement across the grid is restricted. One cannot "skim" a ritual world; one must process through it.

```json
{
  "traversal_id": "TRV_PILGRIMAGE_V1",
  "mode": "SPIRAL",
  "intent": "To move from the sensory (Frieze) to the abstract (Truth).",
  "path_logic": {
    "start_point": "Any cell containing 'Bride of quietness'",
    "end_point": "(23,23)",
    "step_limit": 144,
    "backtracking": "PERMITTED_IF_REPAIRING_BREAK"
  },
  "progression_gates": [
    {
      "gate_seq": 1,
      "zone": "ZONE_01_THE_FRIEZE",
      "condition": "Must accumulate 3 'MUSIC' motifs."
    },
    {
      "gate_seq": 2,
      "zone": "ZONE_02_THE_VOID",
      "condition": "Must encounter 'SilenceKind: GAP' and perform 'QUESTION'."
    },
    {
      "gate_seq": 3,
      "zone": "ZONE_CORE_AXIOM",
      "condition": "Must hold role 'JUDGE'. Verification: 'Do not grieve'."
    }
  ],
  "failure_handling": {
    "trigger": "Reader rejects the paradox of the Cold Pastoral.",
    "action": "Route to 'REPAIR_PATH' -> Re-read Stanza 1."
  }
}

```

### 5. Validation Ruleset (Enforcement)

These rules run against the grid state to ensure it remains a Ritual World.

1. **The Keats Paradox Rule (Adjacency A3):**
* `IF` a cell contains "Warm Love" `AND` Neighbor contains "Cold Pastoral"
* `THEN` Adjacency Meaning MUST equal `TENSION`.
* `OPERATOR` Required: `STAGE_CONFLICT`.


2. **The Silence Ratio (Global Constraint):**
* `SUM(Cells where is_silence_cell = true)` must be `>= 57` (approx 10% of 576).
* *Rationale:* Without the "unheard melodies," the grid is merely data, not poetry.


3. **The Continuity Hook:**
* No cell with `world_operation = PRODUCE` may point to a `BROKEN` cell. It must point to `MAINTAIN` or `SEALED`.

### Next Step

Would you like me to instantiate the **Traversal Simulation** for a specific role (e.g., `PILGRIM` vs `ARCHIVIST`), showing exactly which coordinates and text fragments they would encounter in sequence?
