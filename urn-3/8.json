Here is the complete **Ritual Cartography** of the *Ode on a Grecian Urn*, executed according to the James W. Carey “Ritual View” protocol.

This map treats the poem not as a message to be decoded, but as a **ceremony** that the reader enacts to produce a shared reality of permanence, beauty, and communal solace.

---

### **I. CEREMONY DIAGRAMS (The Spatial Geometry)**

These 5 "Chapels" represent the stanza-by-stanza architecture of the ritual.

| **CHAPEL (Stanza)** | **ENTRY (Invitation)** | **CHANT (The Procession)** | **TURN ( The Paradox)** | **SEAL (The Binding)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1: The Invocation** | Address the Urn as "Bride/Child." Establish the sacred object. | Questions pile up ("What men? What gods?"). Shared wonder. | "Wild ecstasy" appears but is frozen in marble. | "Pipes and timbrels" start the music (unheard). |
| **C2: The Suspension** | Invert the senses: Unheard > Heard. | Command the pipes ("Play on"). Address the youth. | The "Kiss" that never happens (infinite desire). | "For ever... fair." The promise of non-decay. |
| **C3: The Saturation** | Litany of the "Happy" boughs. | Repetition of "Happy, happy love." A rhythmic trance. | Recognition of "cloy'd" human passion (the cost). | The Urn is elevated "far above" biological pain. |
| **C4: The Sacrifice** | The procession appears ("Who are these?"). | The Heifer and Priest. The visual pageantry. | The **Empty Town**. Imagining what is absent/silent. | "Desolate." The silence is sealed as permanent loss. |
| **C5: The Covenant** | "Attic Shape." Return to the object itself. | "Tease us out of thought." Mystical negation of logic. | "Cold Pastoral." Acknowledging the artifact's indifference. | "Beauty is Truth." The final creed/formula recited to bind the group. |
