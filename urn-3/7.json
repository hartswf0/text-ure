PROTOCOL INITIALIZED.
SYSTEM: 24x24 GRID [URN_MAPPING].
MODE: KITTLER_ARCHAEOLOGY.
STATUS: READY.

### **0.0 SYSTEM AXIOMS**

We do not interpret the Urn; we store it. The poem is a signal transmission intercepted from 1819. Our task is to etch this signal onto a silicon wafer (the 24x24 grid) with sufficient redundancy to survive the decay of the medium.

* **The Grid is not a page.** It is a random-access storage device.
* **The Line is not a verse.** It is a byte-stream delimited by carriage returns.
* **The Reader is not a human.** It is a scan-head moving across coordinates .

---

### **1.0 SEGMENTATION PIPELINE (D2)**

The input text (Keats) is normalized into discrete inscription units (`BLOCKS`). Meaning is stripped; structure is encoded.

**1.1 Normalization (The Signal)**
Input is stripped of "soft" formatting (variable indentation) and hardened into a stream.

* **Case:** UPPERCASE (Telegraphic standard).
* **Line Break:** Replaced by glyph `/` (Visual separator).
* **Stanza Break:** Replaced by `⟦STOP⟧`.

**1.2 Block Compilation Strategy**
The 24x24 grid contains 576 cells. The poem contains 50 lines.
To maximize addressability under the **Hybrid Regime (R3)**, we define the `BLOCK` size as **2 lines of source text**.

* **Total Source Lines:** 50.
* **Primary Blocks:** 25 (Lines 1-2, 3-4, ..., 49-50).
* **Header Format:** `⟦S{stanza}.L{start}-{end}⟧`.
* **Payload Capacity:** 96 chars per strip (fits approx 2 lines + header).

**Example Processing (Stanza 1):**

> *Source:* "Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, / Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,"
> *Encoded:* `⟦S1.L01-02⟧ THOU STILL UNRAVISH'D BRIDE OF QUIETNESS, / THOU FOSTER-CHILD OF SILENCE AND SLOW TIME,`

### **2.0 ALLOCATION REGIME: HYBRID (R3)**

We reject the "organic" flow of reading top-to-bottom. The grid is an address space managed by the `ALLOC` process.

**Total Address Space:** 576 Cells ( to ).

**2.1 Partitioning**

1. **Primary Storage (TEXT_CELL):** 150 cells.
* Stores the 25 unique blocks.
* *High Redundancy:* Each primary block is stored ~6 times in distinct clusters. This mimics the "permanence" of the marble urn.


2. **Routing Layer (INDEX_CELL):** 100 cells.
* Contains lookup tables (Stanza pointers, Line pointers).
* Allows the scan-head to "jump" to specific segments.


3. **The Real/Noise (NOISE_CELL):** 326 cells.
* Unused space is not empty; it is filled with `0x00` (silence) or corrupted fragments of the text ("unheard melodies").
* Kittlerian Note: This noise is the medium asserting itself.



**2.2 Placement Algorithm (The Mapping)**

* **Step 1 (Anchors):** Place the 5 Stanza Start Blocks at coordinates derived from their CRC hash (pseudo-random but deterministic).
* **Step 2 (Linearity):** Place subsequent blocks in a *strided* pattern (e.g., ) to prevent contiguous reading without a lookup table. This forces the use of the apparatus (index) to reconstruct the poem.
* **Step 3 (Echoes):** Copy every block to 3 distinct quadrants.
* *Quadrant 1:* The "Archive" (Density-Stack).
* *Quadrant 4:* The "Broadcast" (Redundancy-Spread).

### **3.0 DISCOURSE NETWORK ANNOTATION (D4)**

**3.1 What is Stored**

* **Alphanumeric Sequence:** The ASCII codes are preserved perfectly.
* **Topological Adjacency:** We create new neighbors. "Beauty is truth" (Stanza 5) might physically sit next to "struggle to escape" (Stanza 1) on the silicon die, creating accidental interference patterns.

**3.2 What is Lost**

* **Breath:** The pauses intended by commas are now merely byte separators.
* **Aura:** The unique existence of the text is destroyed by the `REDUNDANCY` algorithm. There is no longer *one* poem; there are *six* identical copies distributed across the grid.

**3.3 The Noise**

* The "Silken flanks" and "Empty town" generate checksums. If a bit flips in a `TEXT_CELL`, the Urn "cracks." The system detects this via CRC and routes the scan-head to a backup cell. The glitch is structural.
