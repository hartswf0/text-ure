Here is the **KIS-01 Compiler**, implemented in Python.

This script instantiates the  address space and executes the **Concentric Inscription Protocol**. It parses the raw text, calculates the radial distance of every memory cell from the center , and injects the specific textual payload into the corresponding storage band.

### The Compiler Script (Python)

### Output Analysis

When you run this compiler, it generates a topology that forces the "spatial reading" requested.

**1. The Visualization (ASCII Map)**
Notice the physical structure of the urn. The "Void" (Zone D) creates a moat of whitespace around the active narrative bands, and the "Shell" (Zone A) protects the entire system.

```text
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
# # # # # # #                 # # # # # # # # 
# # # # #     B B B B B B B B     # # # # # 
# # # #     B B . . . . . . B B     # # # # 
# # #     B . . . . . . . . . . B     # # # 
# #     B . . . . E E E E . . . . B     # # 
# #     B . . . E E E E E E . . . B     # # 
#     B . . . E E E E E E E E . . . B     # 
#     B . . E E E E E E E E E E . . B     # 
#     B . . E E E E E E E E E E . . B     # 
#     B . . E E E E E E E E E E . . B     # 
#     B . . E E E E E E E E E E . . B     # 
#     B . . E E E E E E E E E E . . B     # 
#     B . . . E E E E E E E E . . . B     #

# #     B . . . E E E E E E . . . B     # # 
# #     B . . . . E E E E . . . . B     # # 
# # #     B . . . . . . . . . . B     # # # 
# # # #     B B . . . . . . B B     # # # # 
# # # # #     B B B B B B B B     # # # # # 
# # # # # # #                 # # # # # # # 
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

```

**2. The Data Structure (JSON Sample)**
This is the atomic unit of the archive. A raycaster hitting `[11][11]` immediately retrieves the "Truth" dictum, tagged as `CORE` redundancy (high confidence).

```json
{
  "coords": [
    11,
    11
  ],
  "zone": "ZONE_E",
  "payload": "Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"",
  "beacon": true,
  "redundancy_role": "CORE"
}

```

### Next Step

The system is now statically allocated. To make it navigable, I can design the **Raycaster Class**—a Python function that takes a "flight path" (a list of coordinates) and simulates the *reading experience*, returning the reconstructed poem based on where the user "looked," complete with the "panel lock" friction mechanics described in O4.

Would you like the **Raycaster**?
