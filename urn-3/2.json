To fulfill the "map" aspect of your request, I have reconstructed the translation into the **spatial layout** of the original poem. This allows you to read the English text as if it were the original calligram.

Here is the full translation of **Lettre-Océan**, mapped by page.

### **PAGE 2: THE ANTENNA (The Right Hemisphere)**

*This page acts as the Eiffel Tower viewed from above, radiating text like radio waves. Read this starting from the center and moving outward.*

### **How to Navigate the Map**

1. **Start Left (The Postcard):** Read the blocks of text. The narrator is in Europe ("banks of the Rhine"), thinking of his brother in Mexico. He sends a postcard because the mail in Vera Cruz is "not safe" (referencing the Mexican Revolution).
2. **Cross the Bridge ():** The vertical spine represents the transatlantic cable or wireless signal connecting the two continents.
3. **End Right (The Tower):** The signal arrives in Paris (the Eiffel Tower). The layout explodes into a circle. The text mixes **memories of Mexico** (earthquakes, Chapultepec, slang) with the **sounds of Paris** (buses, sirens, gramophones). The "waves" of text radiate outward, broadcasting the memories back to the brother.
