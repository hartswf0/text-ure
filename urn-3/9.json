## Protocol: The Keats Projection

### Operationalizing the "Grecian Urn" as Ritual Architecture

We are not analyzing a poem. We are constructing a **ceremonial space**.

Following Axiom C3 (*Maps do not represent space; maps constitute space*), the text of "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is hereby transmuted into a **Spatial-Semantic Grid**. This grid does not transmit a message about beauty or truth; it is a machine for *rehearsing* the experience of eternity.

The reader does not "read" the grid; the reader *inhabits* the silence of the Urn.

---

### I. The Mapping Pipeline: Converting Semantic Categories to Acts

We strip the text of its literary veneer to reveal the underlying ritual mechanics. We perceive six distinct ceremonial zones based on the **communicative acts** performed (Step P1).

#### Zone A: The Invocations (PRODUCE)

* **Function:** Call the sacred object into attendance. These acts establish the center of the grid.
* **Text Fragments:** "Thou still unravish'd bride," "Sylvan historian," "O Attic shape! Fair attitude!"

#### Zone B: The Interrogations (REPAIR)

* **Function:** Destabilize the secular reality of the reader to make room for the sacred reality of the Urn. These occur at the *Edges*.
* **Text Fragments:** "What men or gods are these?" "What mad pursuit?" "Who are these coming to the sacrifice?"

#### Zone C: The Chants of Stasis (MAINTAIN)

* **Function:** Enforce the law of the new world (Time = 0). Repetition binds the community of readers to the frozen moment.
* **Text Fragments:** "Ah, happy, happy boughs!" "More happy love! more happy, happy love!" "For ever piping," "For ever young."

#### Zone D: The Witnessing (WITNESS)

* **Function:** Describe the scene not as a picture, but as a live event the reader is testifying to.
* **Text Fragments:** "Fair youth, beneath the trees," "Lead'st thou that heifer," "Marble men and maidens."

#### Zone E: The Exiles (TRANSFORM)

* **Function:** Define what is *excluded* from the grid to give the grid definition. The emptiness that gives shape to the form.
* **Text Fragments:** "Thy streets for evermore / Will silent be," "Desolate," "Old age shall this generation waste."

#### Zone F: The Great Seal (SEAL)

* **Function:** Authorize the reality. Close the ceremony.
* **Text Fragments:** "Beauty is truth, truth beauty."

### II. The Spatial-Semantic Grid (24x24 Architecture)

We arrange these acts not linearly, but spatially. The Grid is concentric.

* **The Outer Rim (The Human Boundary):** Where the Reader enters. Defined by **QUESTION** and **INVOCATION**.
* **The Middle Ring (The Frieze):** The Narrative Loop. Defined by **WITNESS** and **CHANT**.
* **The Center (The Void):** The Silence. Defined by **SEAL** and **EXILE**.

#### Architectural Layout Diagram

| Coordinate Zone | Ritual Function | Dominant Act | Acoustic Quality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Perimeter (Rings 1-5)** | Entry & Disorientation | **QUESTION / INVOCATION** | Cacophony ("Pipes," "Timbrels," "Questions") |
| **Mid-Grid (Rings 6-15)** | The Frozen Loop | **CHANT / WITNESS** | Melodic Drone ("Happy," "For Ever," "Soft Pipes") |
| **Core (Rings 16-24)** | The Eternal Static | **SEAL / SILENCE** | Silence ("Desolate," "Cold Pastoral") |

### III. Micro-Mapping: Cell Schema Examples

Here we define the specific "sites of action" (Step P4).

#### Cell: The Threshold (Outer Rim)

```json
{
  "addr": "(02, 02)",
  "act": "INVOCATION",
  "text_fragment": "Thou foster-child of silence and slow time",
  "world_function": "PRODUCE",
  "role_offered_to_reader": "Pilgrim",
  "continuity_hook": "Slow down reader's temporal clock",
  "repetition_tag": "SILENCE_MOTIF"
}

```

#### Cell: The Panic (Outer Rim)

```json
{
  "addr": "(04, 20)",
  "act": "QUESTION",
  "text_fragment": "What struggle to escape? / What pipes and timbrels?",
  "world_function": "REPAIR",
  "role_offered_to_reader": "Investigator",
  "continuity_hook": "Force movement toward the stable Center",
  "repetition_tag": "CHAOS_MOTIF"
}

```

#### Cell: The Infinite Loop (Mid-Grid)

```json
{
  "addr": "(12, 10)",
  "act": "CHANT",
  "text_fragment": "For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!",
  "world_function": "MAINTAIN",
  "role_offered_to_reader": "Congregant",
  "continuity_hook": "Return to start of Chant Band (Do not proceed to bliss)",
  "repetition_tag": "FOREVER_MOTIF"
}

```

#### Cell: The Empty Town (The Void Core)

*Note: This cell is critical. It contains the world *outside* the Urn, which must be sacrificed to maintain the Urn.*

```json
{
  "addr": "(18, 18)",
  "act": "COMMAND",
  "text_fragment": "And, little town... thy streets for evermore / Will silent be",
  "world_function": "TRANSFORM",
  "role_offered_to_reader": "Exile",
  "continuity_hook": "Establish the cost of eternity",
  "repetition_tag": "SILENCE_MOTIF"
}

```

#### Cell: The High Altar (The Core Center)

```json
{
  "addr": "(24, 24)",
  "act": "SEAL",
  "text_fragment": "Beauty is truth, truth beauty",
  "world_function": "MAINTAIN",
  "role_offered_to_reader": "Believer",
  "continuity_hook": "Exit Grid",
  "repetition_tag": "TRUTH_MOTIF"
}

```

### IV. Traversal Paths (Step P6)

Meaning is not retrieved; it is walked.

**1. The Pilgrimage of Stasis (Spiral Inward)**

* **Path:** Start at `(00,00)` (Invocation).
* **Action:** Move through the QUESTIONS of the Outer Rim.
* **Ordeal:** The reader is bombarded by "What? What? What?" until they seek the stability of the Middle Ring.
* **Arrival:** The reader enters the CHANT loop ("Happy, Happy, Happy").
* **Terminal:** The reader reaches the SEAL at the center.

**2. The Circulation of "For Ever" (Closed Loop)**

* **Path:** Restrict movement to Rows 10-15 (Mid-Grid).
* **Action:** Read only the CHANT cells.
* **Experience:** "For ever piping" -> "For ever new" -> "For ever warm" -> "For ever young."
* **Result:** The reader simulates the paralysis of the figures on the Urn. Time is abolished through adjacency.

**3. The Path of the Exile (The Negative Space)**

* **Path:** Jump between cells tagged with "SILENCE" and "DESOLATION."
* **Action:** Trace the geography of what is missing.
* **Experience:** "Silence" -> "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter" -> "Silent be" -> "Silent form."
* **Result:** The reader constructs the *silence* as a physical object.

### V. Philosophical End State

By converting Keats's ode into this grid, we affirm the Carey Logic:

1. **Spatialization:** The poem is no longer a linear description of a pot. It is a circular temple.
2. **Ritual:** The reader does not learn about the Urn; the reader performs the act of stopping time.
3. **Reality:** The "Little Town" is not a fictional place in the poem; it is the *actual* emptiness created in the reader's mind when they enter the "Cold Pastoral."

The grid has successfully repaired the fracture between the living reader (dying, breathing) and the marble men (eternal, dead).

**Would you like me to render the specific "CHANT" band (the Middle Ring) as a visual ASCII table to demonstrate how adjacency produces the sensation of eternity?**
