    "Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem",
    "If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.",
    "Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,",

    "The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;",
    "They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,",
    "They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;",

    "With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;",
    "Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:",
    "Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.",
    "And the whole war came out, and met the eye;",
    "And each bold figure seem'd to live or die.",
    "A field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,",
    "The third time labour'd by the sweating hind;",
    "The shining shares full many ploughmen guide,",
    "And turn their crooked yokes on every side.",
    "Still as at either end they wheel around,",
    "The master meets them with his goblet crown'd;",
    "The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,",
    "Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:",
    "Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;",
    "And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.",
    "Another field rose high with waving grain;",
    "With bended sickles stand the reaper train:",
    "Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,",
    "Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.",
    "With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;",
    "The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;",
    "And last the children, in whose arms are borne",
    "(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.",
    "The rustic monarch of the field descries,",

    "A ready banquet on the turf is laid,",
    "Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.",
    "The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;",
    "The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.",
    "Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,",
    "Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;",
    "A deeper dye the dangling clusters show,",
    "And curl'd on silver props, in order glow:",
    "A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;",
    "And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.",
    "To this, one pathway gently winding leads,",
    "Where march a train with baskets on their heads,",
    "(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear",
    "The purple product of the autumnal year.",
    "To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,",
    "Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;",
    "In measured dance behind him move the train,",
    "Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.",
    "Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,",
    "Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,",
    "And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores",
    "A rapid torrent through the rushes roars:",
    "Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,",
    "And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.",
    "Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd;",
    "And seized a bull, the master of the herd:",
    "He roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;",
    "They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.",
    "The dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,",
    "Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.",
    "Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads",
    "Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,",
    "And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;",
    "And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.",
    "A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen",
    "In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,",
    "Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band",
    "Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.",
    "The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;",
    "The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:",
    "Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;",
    "Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,",
    "That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.",
    "Now all at once they rise, at once descend,",
    "With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,",
    "Confusedly regular, the moving maze:",
    "Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,",
    "And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:",
    "So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,",
    "And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.",
    "The gazing multitudes admire around:",
    "Two active tumblers in the centre bound;",
    "Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:",
    "And general songs the sprightly revel end.",
    "Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd",
    "With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:",
    "In living silver seem'd the waves to roll,",
    "And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.",
    "This done, whate'er a warrior's use requires",
    "He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,",
    "The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd",
    "With various sculpture, and the golden crest.",
    "At Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:",
    "She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,",
    "Swift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,",
    "And bears the blazing present through the skies."
