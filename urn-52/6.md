    Rebuild the “map the urn and every line” task using James W. Carey’s ritual view of communication.

    Treat the urn/ode not as information to transmit but as a symbolic process that PRODUCES, MAINTAINS, REPAIRS, and TRANSFORMS a shared world in time.

    Output is a “ritual cartography” that makes the poem inhabitable: a map-of and a map-for.

  <first_principles>

    <p id="FP1">Communication is a symbolic process whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired, and transformed.</p>

    <p id="FP2">Two models run in parallel: TRANSMISSION (message across space) and RITUAL (shared order across time). Prefer RITUAL.</p>

    <p id="FP3">Texts are ceremonies: reading is attending a mass. The “urn” is not an object; it is a staging device for commonness (communion/community/communication).</p>

    <p id="FP4">A map is not a copy; it is an instrument that configures experience. The map changes the world it “describes.”</p>

  </first_principles>

</prompt>Ode on a Grecian Urn



By John Keats

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,

       Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,

Sylvan historian, who canst thus express

       A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:

What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape

       Of deities or mortals, or of both,

               In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?

       What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?

What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?

               What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?



Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard

       Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;

Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,

       Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:

Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave

       Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;

               Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,

Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;

       She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,

               For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!



Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed

         Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;

And, happy melodist, unwearied,

         For ever piping songs for ever new;

More happy love! more happy, happy love!

         For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,

                For ever panting, and for ever young;

All breathing human passion far above,

         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,

                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.



Who are these coming to the sacrifice?

         To what green altar, O mysterious priest,

Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,

         And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?

What little town by river or sea shore,

         Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,

                Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?

And, little town, thy streets for evermore

         Will silent be; and not a soul to tell

                Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.



O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede

         Of marble men and maidens overwrought,

With forest branches and the trodden weed;

         Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought

As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!

         When old age shall this generation waste,

                Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe

Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,

         "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all

                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."
