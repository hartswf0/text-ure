SPEC (inscription system for spatial reading, 24×24 urn-banded address space)
1) Data model: atomic lines as addressable records

Atomic unit = one poem line (including punctuation).

Each line gets a stable line_id (L01…L50) and semantic tags for retrieval and redundancy planning:

motifs[] = recurring interface handles (silence, time, frozen action, unheard audio, ritual loop, epigram).

entities[] = concrete nouns/actors (urn, youth, lover, priest, town, etc.).

actions[] = verbs/acts (haunts, pipes, pursues, cannot kiss, leads, remains, says, etc.).

2) Panel model: assemblage layer (ekphrasis mechanisms)

Panels are not “themes”; they are retrieval regimes that determine redundancy, beaconing, and lock behavior.

P1 — ADDRESS / INTERROGATION (stanza 1): direct address + question burst (indexable by “What…?”).

P2 — UNHEARD AUDIO / FROZEN SONG (stanza 2): audible vs inaudible channel split; the “play on” loop.

P3 — AFFECT LOOP / PERPETUAL SPRING (stanza 3): eternal “for ever” recursion; physiological overflow.

P4 — RITUAL LOOP / EMPTY TOWN (stanza 4): procession to sacrifice; “cannot return” closure.

P5 — EPIGRAM OUTPUT / COLD PASTORAL (stanza 5): archive-level statement + final quote.

3) Grid geometry: urn-banded memory layout (no randomness)

Grid coordinates: x ∈ [0..23] (circumference), y ∈ [0..23] (vertical bands).

Wrap: x wraps (urn frieze loop), y does not.

Spine column: x=0 reserved for beacons/index/control (high reliability channel).

Seam column: x=23 reserved for row seam markers + row checksum (error localization).

Panel bands (row ranges):

P0 (Index/Help): y=0..2

P1: y=3..6

P2: y=7..10

P3: y=11..14

P4: y=15..18

P5: y=19..23

4) Redundancy roles (channel strategy, not aesthetics)

core: canonical storage of a line at a stable primary address.

echo: paired-line compression duplicates (improves recall under partial traversal).

glue: motif crosslinks + panel-to-panel handshakes (reduces seek cost).

5) Beacon grammar + raycaster behavior (retrieval ruleset)

Beacon cell payload grammar (ASCII-safe, deterministic):

payload_text begins with §

Format: §B|<panel_id>|<beacon_type>|<label>|<crc>

Example: §B|P2|LOCK|UNHEARD_AUDIO|7C

CRC is deterministic: crc8(seed + "|" + panel_id + "|" + beacon_type + "|" + label).

Panel lock

On hit of §B|*|LOCK|*, set active_panel = panel_id.

While locked:

sampling bias favors cells whose panel_id == active_panel

crossing into another panel band requires an §B|active_panel|EXIT|... or incurs a steep penalty (seek cost).

Seek cost metric

cost = |dx| + 2*|dy| + 6*(panel_switches) + 10*(lock_breaks)

Panel switches are detected when the best next “hit” cell is outside the current/locked panel.

6) Compiler plan: beam-friendly single string without destroying structure

Goal: serialize panels into a single stream that can be re-expanded into panels/lines/cells.

Panel seam marker: ⟂PANEL⟂

Line-break glyph: ␤ (literal U+2424 “SYMBOL FOR NEWLINE”)

Cell seam marker: ⟂CELL⟂

Encoding order (“beam order”): band-major then around-urn

for y=0..23, for x=0..23 (with x wrap semantics at read time)

emit ⟂CELL⟂@(x,y)|panel|role|beacon|line_ids|payload␤

Preserve structure by including:

explicit panel_id

explicit line_ids

explicit seam tokens

row seam checksums (from seam column) for resync.
