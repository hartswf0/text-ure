  <intent>

    You are designing an INSCRIPTION SYSTEM for spatial reading.

    Treat the 24x24 grid as ADDRESS SPACE (memory), not decoration.

    The goal is to compile a long text into a navigable archive where navigation equals reading.

  </intent>



  <axioms>

    <a1>Medium = channel + storage + addressing + error behavior. Do not romanticize.</a1>

    <a2>Meaning is an interface effect. Your job is to engineer the conditions for stable retrieval.</a2>

    <a3>Segmentation is multi-resolution: some passages demand redundancy across many cells; others compress into one cell.</a3>

    <a4>Every atomic line must exist somewhere (completeness), but not every atomic line must be equally spatially large (allocation).</a4>

  </axioms>



  <inputs>

    <text id="SOURCE_TEXT">[PASTE: Ode on a Grecian Urn]</text>

    <grid width="24" height="24"/>

    <cell_display_capacity chars="480"/>

  </inputs>



  <required_outputs>

    <o1>

      A LINE INDEX assigning each line:

      line_id, stanza, line_number, text, motifs[], entities[], actions[].

    </o1>



    <o2>

      A PANEL MODEL (assemblage layer):

      panels[] with id, title, rationale, member_line_ids[], tagset[].

      Panels must reflect EKPHRASIS MECHANISMS (address, frozen action, unheard audio, ritual loop, epigram output).

    </o2>



    <o3>

      A GRID ALLOCATION:

      cells[x][y] each with:

      panel_id, line_ids[], payload_text, beacon (true/false), redundancy_role ("core"|"echo"|"glue").

      Enforce: all line_ids appear at least once in the grid.

    </o3>



    <o4>

      A RETRIEVAL RULESET for the raycaster:

      - beacon detection grammar (how headers are encoded)

      - panel_lock behavior (when beacons hit, sampling biases within panel range)

      - seek cost metric (movement cost between panels)

    </o4>



    <o5>

      A COMPILER PLAN:

      describe how to turn panels into a single beam-friendly string WITHOUT destroying structure.

      Must preserve seam markers and internal line-break glyphs.

    </o5>

  </required_outputs>



  <constraints>

    <c1>No random placement. Any stochasticity must be seeded and explainable.</c1>

    <c2>Redundancy must be justified as channel strategy (error tolerance / recall / anchoring), not aesthetics.</c2>

    <c3>Prefer circular-banded geometry for the URN world (storage bands / frieze loop).</c3>

  </constraints>



</prompt> Ode on a Grecian Urn



By John Keats

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,

       Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,

Sylvan historian, who canst thus express

       A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:

What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape

       Of deities or mortals, or of both,

               In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?

       What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?

What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?

               What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?



Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard

       Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;

Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,

       Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:

Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave

       Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;

               Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,

Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;

       She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,

               For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!



Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed

         Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;

And, happy melodist, unwearied,

         For ever piping songs for ever new;

More happy love! more happy, happy love!

         For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,

                For ever panting, and for ever young;

All breathing human passion far above,

         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,

                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.



Who are these coming to the sacrifice?

         To what green altar, O mysterious priest,

Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,

         And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?

What little town by river or sea shore,

         Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,

                Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?

And, little town, thy streets for evermore

         Will silent be; and not a soul to tell

                Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.



O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede

         Of marble men and maidens overwrought,

With forest branches and the trodden weed;

         Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought

As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!

         When old age shall this generation waste,

                Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe

Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,

         "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all

                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."
