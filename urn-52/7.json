Cool—I'll turn your Carey “ritual-first” POML into an executable-style protocol, then apply it directly to *Ode on a Grecian Urn* to map the poem as a symbolic world-production system (not a message).


## CAREY RITUAL-FIRST WORLD-MODELING PROTOCOL

**Operationalizing James W. Carey’s Cultural Approach as a generative world-model, then executing it on Keats’s *Ode on a Grecian Urn*.**
*(Ritual is primary; transmission is secondary and constrained.)*

---

### 0) Ontological Lock

**O0.1 — Communication is world-activity.**
Treat every communicative artifact as a **world-making practice** that can be *inhabited*, not a container that can be “decoded.”

**O0.2 — Meaning is enacted, not delivered.**
Interpretation is not extraction; it is **participation** in a symbolic form that maintains (or alters) a shared reality.

**O0.3 — The artifact is an ethical instrument.**
Every model we build from the artifact also **builds** the world it claims to describe.

---

### 1) Inputs / Outputs (Executable Framing)

**INPUTS**

* `Artifact`: a symbolic form (poem, urn, interface, newspaper, ritual script)
* `Participants`: reader/viewer + any implied roles the artifact recruits
* `Recurrence_Context`: how the artifact is repeatedly encountered (daily, seasonal, institutional, classroom, museum)
* `World_Tension`: what the artifact stabilizes (continuity) and what it strains against (mortality, conflict, doubt)

**OUTPUTS**

* `World_Model`: entities + relations + constraints + temporal logic
* `Ritual_Script`: how participants are recruited, moved, and returned
* `Ritual_Ops_Map`: PRODUCE / MAINTAIN / REPAIR / TRANSFORM assignments
* `Ethical_Profile`: what kind of world it makes easier to live in (and what it makes harder)

---

### 2) Ritual-First Procedure (Steps are mandatory)

#### Step R1 — Identify the Ceremonial Object (the “altar” of the system)

Find the artifact’s **center of gravity**: the thing around which participation coheres.

* Output: `Ceremonial_Object`, `Sacred_Qualities`, `Access_Rules`

#### Step R2 — Extract the Participation Contract

List what the artifact asks participants to do (question, behold, imagine, mourn, submit, repeat).

* Output: `Participant_Roles`, `Obligations`, `Prohibitions`

#### Step R3 — Build Symbolic Architecture (space + time)

Map:

* **Spatial order** (what is centered vs peripheral)
* **Temporal order** (what repeats, what is frozen, what is promised)
* Output: `World_Temporality`, `World_Geometry`

#### Step R4 — Map the Four Ritual Operations

Assign each segment of the artifact to one or more ritual operations:

* **PRODUCE** (bring a world into being)
* **MAINTAIN** (keep it coherent across time)
* **REPAIR** (heal the world’s wounds, manage contradiction)
* **TRANSFORM** (replace an exhausted world with a new symbolic settlement)

#### Step R5 — Enforce Displacement + Productivity

* **DISPLACEMENT**: show how the world functions when referents are absent (distance, pastness, silence).
* **PRODUCTIVITY**: show how finite symbols generate infinite inhabitable variations.

#### Step R6 — Ethical Instrument Test

Ask: **What kind of world does this form build, maintain, repair, or replace?**
Then specify risks of drift into control/administration/commodification.

## 3) Execution: *Ode on a Grecian Urn* as Ritual World-Production

### R1 — Ceremonial Object

**Ceremonial_Object:** the Urn-as-medium (a “silent form,” a “sylvan historian”)
**Sacred_Qualities:** silence, endurance, sculpted simultaneity, preserved intensity
**Access_Rules:** you don’t “enter” it physically—you **circle it** through address, gaze, question, and imaginative projection.

**Carey move:** the urn is not a “message source.” It is a **ritual site** that organizes communal attention.

---

### R2 — Participation Contract (what the poem makes you do)

The poem recruits the reader into a ritual posture through:

* **Direct address** (“Thou…”) → establishes a ceremonial relation (you are not reading *about*; you are speaking *to*).
* **Interrogation** (“What men or gods…?”) → forces participatory world-completion.
* **Repetition** (“For ever…”) → installs liturgical time (recurrence, not progress).
* **Submission to silence** (the urn “dost tease us out of thought”) → disciplines cognition into awe/limit.

**Roles created by the ritual:**

* `Speaker-Priest`: officiates the encounter, names the sacred qualities, guides attention.
* `Reader-Participant`: completes the world by imagining; becomes witness.
* `Urn-Oracular-Archive`: answers without speaking; teaches by constraint.
* `Figures-on-Urn`: exemplars of suspended action (desire, festival, sacrifice) functioning as ritual icons.

---

### R3 — Symbolic Architecture (space + time)

**Spatial logic:** the urn’s scenes are arranged like stations around a ceremonial object—**a circuit**, not a line.
**Temporal logic:** the urn manufactures **eternal present**:

* desire that never consummates,
* music that is “unheard” yet “sweeter,”
* spring that never departs,
* procession that never arrives,
* a town forever emptied.

This is not mere “timelessness.” It’s a **designed temporality** that trades resolution for endurance.

---

## 4) Ritual Operations Map (stanza-by-stanza world-function)

### Stanza 1 — **PRODUCE**

**Function:** inaugurates the world and its rules.

* The urn is established as a **bride of quietness** and **foster-child of silence and slow time**: a genealogy of non-communication-as-power (silence that holds).
* The barrage of questions **produces** a populated mythic field (deities/mortals, pursuit, struggle, pipes/timbrels).
  **Ritual effect:** the reader is installed as co-maker: the world appears by being questioned into existence.

### Stanza 2 — **MAINTAIN**

**Function:** stabilizes the world through paradox as liturgy.

* “Heard” vs “unheard” melodies: the poem privileges **symbolic participation** over sensory receipt.
* The lover never kisses; the youth never leaves; trees never bare.
  **Ritual effect:** the system teaches continuity by **freezing consummation**—desire becomes a permanent structure rather than an event.

### Stanza 3 — **MAINTAIN (with REPAIR pressure)**

**Function:** intensifies the maintenance spell (“For ever…”) while acknowledging human costs.

* Ecstatic permanence is celebrated, then contrasted with mortal aftermath: “a burning forehead, and a parching tongue.”
  **Ritual effect:** a repair-function begins to appear: the poem manages the envy/ache that eternal forms provoke in temporal bodies.

### Stanza 4 — **REPAIR**

**Function:** introduces sacrifice to metabolize contradiction (beauty vs pain, permanence vs loss).

* A procession to a “green altar,” a “mysterious priest,” a “heifer lowing”—classic ritual machinery.
* The empty town is the poem’s wound: **absence becomes an enduring feature** (“not a soul to tell…”).
  **Ritual effect:** the world is repaired not by resolving absence, but by **making absence inhabitable**—turning loss into a stable symbolic condition.

### Stanza 5 — **TRANSFORM**

**Function:** converts the encounter into doctrine (a transmissible seal, but only after ritual participation).

* The urn becomes a philosophical agent: it “tease[s] us out of thought / As doth eternity.”
* “Beauty is truth, truth beauty” functions as a **closing rite**: a compact creed that reorders what counts as knowledge.
  **Ritual effect:** the participant exits with a transformed epistemic stance: not “facts received,” but a **world-stance installed**.

*(Transmission note, strictly secondary: the final aphorism can be “sent” and quoted, but it only has force as the residue of the ritual circuit that produced it.)*

---

## 5) Displacement + Productivity (Carey’s symbol engine, explicitly)

### DISPLACEMENT (referents absent, world still works)

* The scenes have no recoverable “original event”; they function precisely because they are **unmoored** from empirical time.
* The town’s desolation is permanent because return is impossible.
  **Result:** absence is not a deficit—it is the **operating condition** of the symbolic world.

### PRODUCTIVITY (finite form → infinite inhabitation)

* Each reading recombines the same fixed icons into new inner dramas: lover/youth/priest/town become **re-usable roles** for any culture wrestling with time, desire, and endurance.
  **Result:** the urn is a generator: a compact symbolic machine yielding endless world-variants.

---

## 6) Ethical Instrument Profile (what kind of world this ritual builds)

**World it tends to build well**

* A world where **continuity** is possible without control.
* A world where **shared attention** becomes a sanctuary against historical churn.
* A world where pain is not erased but **ritualized** into form.

**World-risks (Carey warning translated)**

* Drift into aesthetic administration: treating “beauty” as a managerial substitute for truth.
* Commodification of the ritual object: the urn becomes a brand-token (“quote the line”) instead of a lived ceremony.
* Chilling effect on plural truths: the seal can become a gatekeeping creed if detached from the poem’s enacted ambivalence.

---

## 7) Design Directives (if you build systems from this, ritual-first)

Translate the ode into design constraints for communication systems:

1. **Build a circuit, not a feed.**
   Users should *circle* a central object through stations of attention, not scroll an infinite pipeline.

2. **Privilege recurrence over novelty.**
   The system should reward re-entry (seasonal returns, repeated readings, anniversaries).

3. **Make absence operational.**
   Let missingness (unanswered questions, silent artifacts, irretrievable towns) be a designed feature that organizes participation.

4. **Install roles, not content.**
   Provide participant positions (witness, officiant, chorus, skeptic) that users can inhabit.

5. **End with a seal—but only after enactment.**
   Any “takeaway” must be earned through the ritual path, or it collapses into mere transmission.

## 8) Minimal “Executable” World-Manifest (compact, portable)

```json

  "world_id": "KEATS_URN_RITUAL_WORLD_v1",

  },

}
```

If you want, I can take this same protocol and convert it into a **grid / map operator** (Carey-ritual “ceremonial architecture”) so each stanza becomes a navigable station—*a world you traverse*, not a text you consume.
