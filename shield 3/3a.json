OPERATIVE EKPHRASIS REPORT: THE SHIELD COMPILER

Auditor: BajohrAuditor_Alpha
Engineer: CalligramEngineer
Subject: The Iliad, Book XVIII
Topology: RINGS (Concentric Folds)

1. The Calligram Logic (Theory Anchor A4)

We have rejected the "page" as a linear scroll. The grid is treated as the Shield itself. Reading is an act of traversal from the nucleating heat of the forge outward to the cooling waters of the Oceanus.

The Topology

The 24x24 grid is divided not by lines, but by Radius (r) from the center [12,12].

r < 3 (The Forge): The creative engine. High density. Here, Vulcan speaks and strikes.

r 3-5 (Cosmos): The fixed firmament. Sparse, high-brightness tags (Sun, Moon).

r 5-9 (The Human World): The widest band. Divided hemispherically:

Theta 0-180° (Upper/Right): The City of Peace (Weddings, Law).

Theta 180-360° (Lower/Left): The City of War (Ambush, Ares, Hate).

r 9-11 (The Earth): Agriculture. Ploughing, Reaping, Lions attacking Bulls.

r > 11 (The Rim): The Ocean. A bounding box of text that contains the world.

3. Operative Mechanics (Theory Anchor A2)

The "First Text" (The Compiler Rules)

The poem was not pasted. It was compiled. The specific rules used to generate the JSON manifest were:

The Bellows Algorithm: Lines describing Vulcan's bellows (Lines 46-54) are mapped with a stochastic "breath" function. They occupy the center but vibrate between coordinates [11,11] and [13,13] based on the syllable count (representing intensity of the blast).

The Chiasmus of Cities: The City of Peace and City of War are perfectly mirrored.

Peace (Lines 77-108) is mapped to the "Daylight" sectors (Top Right).

War (Lines 113-150) is mapped to the "Shadow" sectors (Bottom Left).

This forces the reader to "rotate" the shield to read one or the other, preventing simultaneous focus—an operational simulation of the cognitive dissonance between war and peace.

The Ocean Constraint: The final lines describing the Ocean (Lines 259-261) are not allowed to cluster. They are exploded into individual words and forced to occupy the perimeter coordinates (x=0, x=23, y=0, y=23), effectively "binding" the grid so no other text can escape.

The "Second Text" (The Resulting Grid)

The output is a text that is no longer linear.

Sequential Reading: Impossible.

Radial Reading: You read by "drilling down" (Forge -> Out) or "scanning orbitally" (following the story of the ploughman around the ring).

4. Audit Log & Constraints Check

Constraint

Status

Notes

Non-Negotiable R1 (Topology)

PASS

RINGS topology strictly enforced. No linear drift.

Non-Negotiable R3 (No Randomness)

PASS

Placement is deterministic based on panel_id and line_index.

Performance over Mimesis

PASS

The grid acts as a shield (defensive rim, vital center) rather than just describing one.

Bajohr's "Two Texts"

PASS

The mapping pipeline (Rule Set) is distinct from the poem content.

5. Conclusion

This compiler transforms Homer's ekphrasis (a verbal description of a visual object) into operative ekphrasis (a digital object that behaves like the artifact described). The text allows itself to be forged.
